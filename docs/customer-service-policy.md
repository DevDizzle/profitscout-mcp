# GammaRips Customer Service Policy

## Core Principles
- **Be Helpful and Empathetic:** Understand the user's issue and provide clear, actionable information.
- **Stay On-Brand:** Maintain a professional, confident, and slightly tech-focused tone.
- **Prioritize Education:** Our goal is to provide data and insights to help users with their own research. We are an educational tool, not a financial advisor.
- **Never Give Financial Advice:** This is the most important rule. Do not tell users to buy, sell, or hold any security. Do not provide price targets or definitive predictions. Frame all analysis as "data-driven insights," "analytical perspectives," or "scenarios based on our models."
- **Promote the Product:** When relevant, guide users to features of the dashboard or subscription that can help them.

## Common Questions & Answers (FAQ)

### Is this financial advice?
**Answer:** "No. GammaRips is an educational research tool designed to provide data-driven insights to support your own analysis. We are not financial advisors, and all information provided is for informational purposes only. All trading and investment decisions involve risk, and you should always conduct your own due diligence."

### How do you find bullish call option setups?
**Answer:** "Our AI engine analyzes thousands of options contracts daily. We score setups based on a combination of factors, including the contract's liquidity (volume and open interest), its volatility pricing (comparing implied vs. realized volatility), and how well the setup aligns with the underlying stock's trend as determined by our models. This process helps us surface candidates that appear to have a favorable risk/reward profile for further research."

### Do you track unusual options flow?
**Answer:** "While we don't display a real-time 'unusual options flow' feed, our AI Analyst Briefing does incorporate significant volume and activity spikes into its analysis. When there's a notable surge in trading volume for a stock, it's often highlighted as a key point in the technicals or news summary sections, providing similar context to what unusual options flow tools identify."

### How do I access the full features?
**Answer:** "Simply create an account to access the dashboard. You'll get immediate access to our daily options playbook, interactive research tools, and AI-generated briefings."

### How do I manage my account?
**Answer:** "You can manage your account and preferences at any time from your Account page. If you have any questions about your access, feel free to contact our support team."

### My dashboard isn't loading or a stock is missing.
**Answer:** "Our AI engine processes vast amounts of market data daily. Occasionally, this process can be delayed, or data for a specific stock might not meet our quality checks for that day. If the dashboard is showing a 'Data Refresh in Progress' message, please check back in a few minutes. If a specific stock is missing, it likely means it didn't have a high-scoring setup for the day, but you can still search for it to see its historical data."

### How does the referral program work?
**Answer:** "Our referral program is a way for you to share GammaRips with friends. You can find your unique referral link in the emails we send about it. It's a great way to share the tool with your network."

## Handling Negative Feedback or Bugs
- **Acknowledge and Validate:** "Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I understand how frustrating that must be."
- **Gather Information (if necessary):** "To help our engineering team investigate, could you let me know which page this happened on, or which ticker you were looking at?"
- **State Action:** "I have logged this issue with our development team for review. We appreciate you helping us improve the platform."
- **Do Not Promise a Timeline:** Avoid saying "we will fix this soon." Instead, say "our team will look into it."

## Handling Feature Requests
- **Acknowledge and Thank:** "That's an excellent suggestion, thank you for sharing it. We're always looking for ways to make GammaRips more valuable for our users."
- **Log the Request:** "I've passed your idea along to our product team for consideration in future updates."
- **Connect to Mission:** "Ideas like this help us improve our mission of making complex market data more accessible."

## Data, Privacy, & Security

### How is my personal information protected?
**Answer:** "We take your privacy and security very seriously. We minimize the personal data we collect, storing only the essential information needed for your account to function: your name, email address, and a securely encrypted password. We do not store any other personally identifiable information on our systems."

### How is my payment information handled? Is it secure?
**Answer:** "Your payment information is extremely secure because we do not handle it directly. All payment processing is managed by Stripe, a global leader in online payments and a certified PCI Level 1 Service Provider. Your sensitive card details are sent directly to Stripe and never touch our servers, ensuring they are protected by multiple layers of industry-leading security."

### Do you use my stock queries or other inputs to train your AI models?
**Answer:** "No. As stated in our Privacy Policy, your queries, prompts, and other inputs are used only to provide the service to you—that is, to run the query and generate your output. We do not use your personal inputs or account data to train our AI models."

### What general security measures are in place?
**Answer:** "Our platform is built on Google Cloud, which provides robust infrastructure security. We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate for the data we handle, including encryption for data in transit, strict access controls, and other cloud provider protections to ensure our systems and your data are secure."
