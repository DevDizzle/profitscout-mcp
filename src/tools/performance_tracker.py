    """Get performance metrics for tracked options signals.

    Returns historical performance data for signals that were identified by
    the ProfitScout system, including entry price, current price, and P&L.

    **Note:** These are PAPER signals for demonstration purposes. No actual
    trades are executed. Performance is calculated from signal identification
    to current market price or expiration.

    Args:
        status: Filter by status - "Active", "Expired", "Delisted" (default: all)
        ticker: Filter by specific ticker symbol (e.g., "NVDA")
        option_type: Filter by "CALL" or "PUT" (default: both)
        min_gain: Minimum percent gain to filter (e.g., 10.0 for +10%)
        limit: Maximum results to return (default: 50, max: 100)

    Returns:
        JSON with performance summary and individual signal details including:
        - contract_symbol, ticker, option_type, strike_price
        - initial_price (entry), current_price, percent_gain
        - run_date (signal date), expiration_date, status
        - setup_quality_signal, stock_price_trend_signal
